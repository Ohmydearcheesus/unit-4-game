# Crystal Collector

A math game!

## What is Crystal Collector?

A web-based math game, where you try and add numbers together to reach a goal!
There are four random numbers, hidden in crystals, given at the start of the game. These four numbers will stay constant until the goal is met or the numbers added together exceeds the target value.

This goal changes every time after you succeed or go over the target.

The immediate objective for this game is to put together a working version of the game, utilizing jQuery.

The stretch goal for this game is to implement a class to manage the four gem objects, as they're exactly the same as each other save for their names. They all share the same functionality, and therefore would ideally share the same functions in code as well.

## How the game was made

This game is made with HTML and css to display to the browser, and JavaScript with some jQuery to handle the game logic.

## How to play the game

Click on any of the gems, and the gem's hidden number will be added to your current count. Try to make your current count match the target count!

Each of the crystals will have a random value 1 through 12. This will stay the same for each crystal until you meet or go over your current number goal.

If you manage to get your current count to match the goal, you win! And get 1 point!
If you go over the goal number however, you'll lose, and get 1 added to your losses record.
